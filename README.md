# Happiness vs Economic Freedom

For our ETL Project, we will be examining World Happiness and Economic Freedom. Our datasets are coming from kaggle.com. We will be using Pandas and SQL to extract, transform, and load our data into a SQL database. Joining our two datasets, we can more easily compare and contrast a country's happiness ranking against their economic freedom index.
