# ETL-Project

For our ETL Project, we will be examining World Happiness and Economic Freedom. Our datasets are World Happiness Ranking and the Economic Freedom Index. 
We will be using Pandas and SQL to extract, transform, and load our data into a SQL database. With our data, we can examine a country's happiness ranking versus
their economic freedom index.
